# Minecraft-More-Eats-Mod
This mod is one of the most useful mods I could think of, More Eats. Most people would think that more eats would mean I’m adding new foods. Well, that’s wrong. This mod has no new items, but it allows you to eat a large variety of items you would not normally think about eating and can’t eat. This mod adds edible items, which some have effects added to them like golden apples or rotten flesh. Here is a list of what items are now edible and their effects (if they have any).  Diamond: (16pts) effects; regeneration, absorption Coal: (6pts)effects; hunger (60% change) Iron Ingot: (8pts) effects; none Gold Ingot: (10pts) effects; none Iron Nugget: (1pts) effects; none Gold Nugget (2pts) effects; none Redstone Dust: (10pts) effects; night vision(20% chance) Emerald: (12pts) effects; hero of the village Lapis Lazuli: (10pts) effects; haste Stick: (1pts) effects; none Oak Planks: (3pts) effects; none Spruce Planks: (3pts) effects; none Jungle Planks: (3pts) effects; none Acacia Planks: (3pts) effects; none Dark Oak Planks: (3pts) effects; none Birch Planks: (3pts) effects; none Stone: (4pts) effects; none Cobblestone: (3pts) effects; none     CURRENTLY THIS MOD IS INCOMPLETE. I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A FEW OTHER PROJECTS AND THIS TAKES TIME. THANKS FOR DOWNLOADING AND KEEP CHECKING FOR UPDATES.
